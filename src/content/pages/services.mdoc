By the time you've arrived for your first visit, you have probably already spoken to me.&nbsp; I like to talk to my potential clients for a few minutes on the phone to make sure that I am the right fit for your needs and to answer any questions you might have. I also find that it makes you feel more comfortable and at ease to have had a conversation prior to us meeting for the first time.\
&nbsp;\
Allow 60 min for the first session. Each subsequent session runs 45 minutes long.
